---

### `02_basics`
Practice with collections:
- Arrays and objects using multiple variations and examples:
  - `01_arrays.js`
  - `02_object.js`
  - `03_objects.js`
  - `04_object.js`

---

### `03_basics`
Functions and related concepts:
- `01_function.js` & `02_function.js` ‚Äì Function declarations
- `03_scopes.js` ‚Äì Scope in JS
- `04_this.js` ‚Äì Understanding `this` keyword
- `05_arrowFunction.js` ‚Äì Arrow functions
- `06_IIFE.js` ‚Äì Immediately Invoked Function Expressions

---

### `04_ControlFlow`
Flow control in JavaScript:
- `01_ifElse.js`
- `02_switch.js`
- `03_ThruthyFalsy.js`
- `04_OtherOperators.js`

---

### `05_Loops`
Looping constructs in JavaScript:
- 5 files (`01_.js` to `05_.js`) covering different loop types and use cases

---

### `06_Dom`
Basic DOM manipulation:
- `01_.html` to `03_.html` for DOM selection and updates

---

### `07_Dom_Projects`
Mini projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
- **Project 01:** Changing background color using buttons
- **Project 02:** BMI Calculator
- **Project 03:** Digital Clock
- **Project 04:** Guess a Number Game  
Each project contains:
```
index.html
index.js
style.css
```

---

### `08_Events`
Event handling in JavaScript:
- **Folder 1:** Event Bubbling/Propagation vs Capturing Mode
- **Folder 2:** Mini project - Removing images using event delegation without deleting parent elements

---

### `09_AsynJs`
Practicing asynchronous concepts:
- `setTimeout()`
- `setInterval()`

---

### `10_AsynJs_Projects`
Mini async JavaScript projects:
- **Project 01:** Change body background color every second
- **Project 02:** Show key pressed by the user  
Each project includes:
```
index.html
index.js
```

---

### `11_Advance_JS`
More advanced JavaScript:
- **Folder 1:** Working with APIs using XML HTTP Request
- **Folder 2:** Creating and consuming Promises

---

### `12_Oops`
Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript:
- Object creation, prototypes, inheritance, classes, static methods, getters/setters
- Files:  
  `01_object.js` to `11_Getters_Setters.js` (11 files total)

---

### `13_More topics`
Deep dives into core concepts:
- `01_LexicalScoping.html`
- `02_Closures.html`

---

## üß† Key Concepts Practiced

- Variables, datatypes, and operations
- Functions and scopes
- Control flow and loops
- DOM manipulation and mini projects
- Events and event delegation
- Asynchronous programming
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Closures, lexical scoping, and more

---

## üîó How to Run

For `.js` files:  
You can run them using Node.js or browser developer tools.

For `.html` files:  
Open in your browser and inspect the console output or page behavior.

## üìå Note

This repo is purely for practice and personal learning. Each folder focuses on improving JavaScript fundamentals through hands-on examples and mini projects.
